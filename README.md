# Project Boat

A multiplayer ship-fighting prototype made using Unreal Engine 4.27. The players can choose from different ship types to fight with in the arena. The goal is to deliver the most packages to ports while avoiding or sinking others. You can use different abilities to your advantage, like jumping, boosting or shooting torpedoes.

2 people contributed to this project, a friend of mine created the 3d assets and visual effects, while the coding was done by me.
The multiplayer experience is created using the Steam Online Subsystem, and we used the NULL online subsystem in editor for easier testing.

Before the project got put on the side we started to turn it into a game with multiple game modes like racing, but we never really finished exploring those ideas.
